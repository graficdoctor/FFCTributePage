          Morrison, who was the first black woman in history to win the Nobel
          Prize for Literature, was a legendary novelist whose work explored
          American identity, often through overlapping, fractured lenses of
          racial and gender identity.

        <h2 id="headline">Here's a time line of Toni Morrisons' life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1931</strong> - Born Chloe Ardelia Wofford in Lorain, Ohio,
            US.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1943</strong> - She became a catholic as a 12-year old and
            took the baptismal name Anthony, which led to her nickname, Toni.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1949</strong> - She enrolled at Howard University in
            Washington, D.C., seeking the company of fellow black intellectuals.
            It was while at Howard that she encountered racially segregated
            restaurants and buses for the first time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1965</strong> - After her divorce in 1965, Morrison began
            working as an editor. In 1967 she transferred to Random House in New
            York City, where she became their first black woman senior editor in
            the fiction department. In that capacity, Morrison played a vital
            role in bringing Black literature into the mainstream. One of the
            first books she worked on was the groundbreaking
            <i>Contemporary African Literature</i> (1972), a collection that
            included work by Nigerian writers <b>Wole Soyinka</b>,
            <b>Chinua Achebe</b>, and South African playwright
            <b>Athol Fugard</b>. She fostered a new generation of Afro-American
            writers, including poet and novelist <b>Toni Cade Bambara</b> ,
            radical activist <b>Angela Davis</b>, Black Panther
            <b>Huey Newton</b> and novelist <b>Gayl Jones</b> .
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1970</strong> - Morrison had begun writing fiction as part
            of an informal group of poets and writers at Howard University who
            met to discuss their work. She attended one meeting with a short
            story about a black girl who longed to have blue eyes. Morrison
            later developed the story as her first novel, <i>The Bluest Eye</i>,
            getting up every morning at 4 am to write, while raising two
            children alone.

            Morrison had discovered when compiling<i>The Black Book</i>. Garner
            had escaped slavery but was pursued by slave hunters. Facing a
